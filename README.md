🧠 Handwritten Digit Recognition

🧩 Overview

This project demonstrates an end-to-end deep learning pipeline for recognizing handwritten digits similar to the MNIST dataset.
Built using TensorFlow CNNs and a sleek Streamlit interface, it allows you to:
- Draw digits on a canvas ✍️  
- Capture digits via webcam 📷  
- Get instant predictions with confidence scores ⚡  
- Log feedback for continuous model improvement 🔄  
- View analytics dashboards 📊 (accuracy, confusion matrix)

⚙️ Tech Stack
-Frontend/UI
🖥️ Streamlit — Interactive web app framework
🎨 Streamlit DrawCanvas — Digit drawing interface
-Backend & Model
🧠 PyTorch — Deep learning model training and inference
🧮 NumPy, OpenCV — Image preprocessing and transformations
-Data & Analytics
📊 Pandas — CSV data logging and processing
📈 Seaborn & Matplotlib — Data visualization
🗃️ CSV-based logging system (extendable to SQL or NoSQL DB)

🌟 Features
Real-time Digit Prediction — Draw a digit and get instant prediction with confidence.
Prediction Logging — Every input and prediction is logged with timestamp, confidence, and feedback.
Analytics Dashboard — Visualize model performance and user input trends.
Confusion Analysis — Heatmap showing which digits are most often confused.
Accuracy Monitoring — Track daily accuracy trends from feedback logs.
Lightweight & Portable — No heavy dependencies beyond core ML and visualization libs.
